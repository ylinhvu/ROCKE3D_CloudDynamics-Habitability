# ROCKE3D_CloudDynamics-Habitability
ROCKE3D is a planetary GCM designed by NASA GISS and is commonly used to explore the atmospheric and oceanic dynamics of exoplanets. My project uses model output from ROCKE-3D to explore the relationship between cloud dynamics and surface temperature, with surface temperature serving as metric of habitability..
